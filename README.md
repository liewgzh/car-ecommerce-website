Car E-commerce Application

Overview
The Car E-commerce Application is a web-based platform designed for users to browse, view, and add luxury cars. 
Built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, this application provides a seamless experience for car enthusiasts and potential buyers. 
The project showcases my ability to develop a full-stack application, implement RESTful APIs, and manage a MongoDB database.

Dynamic Car Listings: Users can view a list of available cars with details such as name, make, model, year, price, and image.
Car Details Page: Each car has a dedicated details page that provides more in-depth information.
Add New Car: Admin users can add new cars to the inventory through a dedicated form.
RESTful API: The application exposes a RESTful API for fetching car data and adding new cars, allowing for easy integration with other services.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Node.js, Express
Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose for object data modeling)
Version Control: Git
